The natural reproductive ability of *Clarias gariepinus* diminishes under industrial aquaculture conditions, often requiring hormonal interventions to induce gametogenesis (Lyubomirova et al., 2021). This reliance on hormonal treatments highlights the need for breeding programs that focus on enhancing stock resilience and viability. Crossbreeding techniques have shown promise in addressing issues related to genetic diversity, improving growth and survival rates (Sunarma et al., 2016). The use of molecular markers, such as HSP70, is instrumental in characterizing genetic factors related to reproduction and stress responses, which is critical for developing effective breeding programs aimed at enhancing the sustainability of African catfish aquaculture (Nasrullah et al., 2019; Sipos et al., 2019). These programs are essential for ensuring that catfish farming remains a viable and productive industry in Nigeria.
